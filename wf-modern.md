# Warfighter Modern rules questions

## Discard and Draw on turn 1
> At the start of the game, if there are no Player Soldiers with a Location Marker card, 
you must spend Actions to Discard and Draw until someone draws a Location Marker card 

*UVR page 36, paragraph 2*

Does mean you can't do anything else besides take the "Discard and Draw" standard action until you get your first location?
e.g. Canteen, Local Knowledge

### Discord consensus: No
People generally play this to mean that you need a location card to get started, but how that location card is obtained isn't restricted.

## What happens if you go to place a hostile when the targeting cup is empty?
> When you draw a Hostile
card, draw a Hostile
Targeting counter from
the cup to see which
Soldier the Hostile will be Attacking.

*UVR page 36, paragraph 11*

### Discord consensus
Add 4 more counters to the cup for each Soldier on the board, then draw a random targeting counter.

## How is the squad RP value calculated for spawning hostiles in a location?
> When you play a Location card, immediately resolve
the card text, and then draw Hostile cards based on
the team’s current Resource Point value and place
the Hostiles in the new Location card.

*UVR page 36, paragraph 5*

### Discord take
Extra ammo alters the cost of the associated weapon, but does not have an RP cost during the mission.  
Trashing the weapon makes the ammo "free" for purposes of RP computation.

### Discord take
If the pistol only carries 2 ammo, and you drop the mp5 and switch all 8 ammo to the pistol 
I would think that now becomes 4 additional RP of ammo on the pistol

## Are 40mm grenades purchaseable as ammo?
> You can purchase extra
Ammo for Player Soldier
Weapons before a Mission.
Each extra Ammo purchase
costs 1 Resource Point and 1
Loadout point. Buying extra
Ammo gives you a number of
Ammo counters equal to the
number noted on the Weapon
card that you are purchasing extra Ammo for.

*UVR page 28, paragraph 1*

### Official Response
> My reading is that you would spend 1 RP for the number of Ammo counters listed on the card, as per the rule on purchasing weapon Ammo - 
> in the case of L84A2 Rifle w/Grenade Launcher or M320 Grenade Launcher, it would be 3 x 40mm Grenades as printed on the card.

### Discord take
> When the rules and cards refer to “Ammo” they are only
referring to these counters. They are not referring to
Grenades, Rockets, etc

*UVR page 7, paragraph 19*

You cannot buy any extra 40mm grenades to your launcher, because there is no mention about it and they are not ammo. 
Rulebook says specifically they are not ammo.

### Discord take
UVR page 7, paragraph 19 is referring to the "Gear and Grenade Counters" mentioned on page 8, not all grenades and rockets.
